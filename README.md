## Music Playlist Creator

This app uses the Spotify API to fetch artist data form the Spotify database, allowing the user to look up information by Artist, Album, or song.

You can create your own playlist and save it locally. Users can modify their playlists or delete the entire playlist and create more.

The interface is smooth and simple to use, using TailwindCSS for all styling.
